# Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer using Wavelets and Neural Networks
## What is it for?
This is a project for early detection of lung cancer using MATLAB. Different method were used but mainly 2D wavelets, stepwise fit, and neural networks were used.


## How to use it?
1. Download the pationated dataset from the link below and copy it to the project folder
2. Run the main file "getFeatures" to get the final selected features
3. Run the function "getNNWithAcc" with a parameter of lower-bound accuracy to find a specific NN
4. Alternativly you can run "NN100_308" which a NN with 96.8% total accuracy
